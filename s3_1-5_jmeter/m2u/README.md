JMeter JTL to JUnit test results converter.

This project aims to ease conversion from JMeter JTL format to JUnit-compatible XML. This is due to some continuous 
integration systems (namely Hudson/Jenkins) support only a subset of JTL spec and/or take a very opinionated way of
displaying the results, which makes them unusable if JMeter is used for functional testing.

Currently only these JMeter JTL elements are supported:

* `<sample/>`
* `<httpSample/>`


## How to build it?
In order to build this jar, just run maven without any arguments:

    $ mvn

## How to use it?
    java -jar jtl2junit.jar --input <jmeter.jtl> --output <junit.xml> [--testSuiteName <name of the test suite>]

If the `<name of the test suite>` argument is not given, it will default to `jmeter`.
